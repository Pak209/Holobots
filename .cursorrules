### Current Issue: Stat Updates Not Reflecting Immediately
Problem: When spending stat points, changes don't appear until page refresh and aren't reflected in battle/training TCGs.

Investigation Plan:
1. State Synchronization
   - Track stat update flow from point of change
   - Verify event propagation to all components
   - Ensure consistent state structure across components

2. Event Propagation
   - Monitor custom events reaching components
   - Validate event handling in TCG components
   - Check component subscription to state changes

Logging Implementation:
- Add logs in stat upgrade handling
- Track event propagation
- Monitor component updates
- Verify state consistency

Action Items:
1. Implement comprehensive logging
2. Validate assumptions about state flow
3. Identify exact point of synchronization failure
4. Design fix based on findings
